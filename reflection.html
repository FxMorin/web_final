  <p>Responsive design is basically a design that will change its size to match the size required, which means it will allow a website to be seen on all types of different screen sizes. This is why web technologies use it, it allows us to have websites that can be viewed on any device no matter its screen size.
  I used Viewpoint for my responsive design, since it allows it to be easily changed depending on the view size of the device. I have built a lot of websites before, many that are responsive so I haven't learnt that much.
For this project I decided to try making a 3d model generator, it took most of my time, but allowed me to really show the responsive device by allowing canvases to change size and create elements based on viewpoint.</p>
